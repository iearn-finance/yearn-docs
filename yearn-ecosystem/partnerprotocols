#Akropolis

[Akropolis](www.https://www.akropolis.io/) is a provider of decentralized finance products with an emphasis on asset yield generation. 
Their mission is to give users (both new and crypto-native) the tools to save, grow and provision for the future safely, with access to a variety of non-fiat and non-inflationary assets, without dependence on geography or central counterparty. 
To do this, Akropolis offers an easy-to-use yield aggregator product featuring curated best-in-class yield generation strategies from various protocols across DeFi, as well as developing our own yield-generation strategies on multiple chains.
